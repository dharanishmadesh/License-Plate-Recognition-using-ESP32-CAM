# 📸 ESP32-CAM Vehicle Number Plate Recognition 🚗💡

### 🔍 Overview:
This project uses the **ESP32-CAM** to capture vehicle number plate images, send them to the cloud for recognition, and display results on an OLED screen. With seamless integration of IoT and AI, it brings the power of automation to everyday applications like parking systems, toll booths, and more.

### 🌟 Features:
- 📷 **Image Capture**: Captures high-quality images using the ESP32-CAM.  
- 🔒 **Secure Cloud Communication**: Sends images to a cloud server over HTTPS.  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Recognition**: Extracts and processes number plate data using ML models on the cloud.  
- 📟 **OLED Display Support**: Displays status and results on an SSD1306 OLED screen.  
- 🔆 **Flashlight Support**: Built-in LED for better image clarity in low light.  
- 🚀 **Easy Integration**: API support for integration with other devices.

### 🛠️ Components Required:
- 🟢 **ESP32-CAM Module**  
- 🖥️ **OLED Display (SSD1306)**  
- 🔘 **Push Button** (Trigger button)  
- 💡 **LED Flashlight**  

---

### 🚀 How It Works:
1. **Press the trigger button** to capture an image.  
2. The image is sent securely to the cloud server via HTTPS.  
3. The server processes the image using a machine learning model.  
4. Recognized data (e.g., number plate details) is sent back and displayed on the OLED.

### 📦 Project Setup:
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/esp32cam-number-plate-recognition.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries in the Arduino IDE:  
   - **Adafruit GFX Library**  
   - **Adafruit SSD1306**  
   - **WiFi**  
   - **WiFiClientSecure**  

3. Modify the following placeholders in the code:  
   - Replace `xxx` with your **WiFi SSID and Password**.  
   - Replace `xxx` with your **API Key**.  
   - Update the **Server Name** and **API Endpoint** if necessary.  

4. Upload the code to your ESP32-CAM and connect the hardware components as described in the comments.
